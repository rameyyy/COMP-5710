* Bandit Scan *
The scan covered 3,401 lines of code in Python files that came from the workshop2.zip file. 
It identified 52 total issues.


* Three Most Frequent Security Weaknesses *

1. B101: assert_used - had 30 occurrences of low severity
The code uses assert all over the place to check conditions. The problem is
that assert gets removed if Python runs with the -O flag, so those checks
will just vanish.

2. B311: random - had 7 occurrences of low severity
The code uses Python's built-in random module in several spots. Random
isn't safe for security, so it shouldn't be used for things like generating
tokens or keys.

3. B614: pytorch_load - had 5 occurrences of medium severity
torch.load() uses pickle to load model files, and if someone swaps in a
malicious file it could run unwanted code on your machine when loaded.
